# fan-controller
A fan controller script for the Raspberry Pi

###Setup
Currently this script will run in any directory. Just start it with <python3 fancontrol.py>.

###TODO
Create a startup Bash script.

Create a SystemD service to start on boot

Create a DEB package.

Actually get people to notice ;)


###Contributing
Follow your own habits bit create a pull request that will be reviewed then hopefully merged

###FUTURE
I think this will become a useful script with Linux enthuiasts who own a Raspberry Pi and open-source gamers who overclock their Pis. However there maybe a few troubles expanding on this idea. This project follows unix philosphy. Each script does one thing and does it well.
